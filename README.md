# novelty-lab

A calibration-first laboratory for turning mathematically plausible ideas into
auditable research claims.

Nothing in this repository is called novel merely because it follows from a
classical theorem. Every project begins as a **candidate** and advances only
after a literature record, an exact statement, and reproducible evidence exist.

## Active candidates

| ID | Program | Current label | First gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Certified Cayley–Dickson division/splitting decisions | candidate — artifact novelty | audit Lean/mathlib coverage and state hypotheses |
| N3 | Shell collision multiplicities modulo ℓ | candidate — experimental | unit-orbit-aware Poisson baseline |
| N2 | Octonionic navigation and finite quotients | candidate — research-grade | literature clearance and well-defined generator model |
| N4 | Explicit certified shell/golden-gate discrepancy | candidate — dependent | pin an explicit theorem with constants |
| N5 | Multiset budget signatures for Nielsen witnesses | candidate — exact finite classification | define exact minimizer and rerun the complete S6 census |

The execution order is N1 → N3 → N2 → N4 → N5. See
[the calibration policy](docs/calibration.md) and the per-candidate dossiers in
[docs/candidates](docs/candidates).

## Layout

| Path | Authority |
|---|---|
| `kernel/n1/` | canonical N1 certificate checker (exact arithmetic over ℚ) |
| `experiments/` | non-authoritative search and data generation |
| `data/` | committed experimental outputs, hashed in the ledger |
| `schemas/` | versioned certificate formats |
| `research/candidates.json` | programme registry (calibration ladder) |
| `research/ledger.json` | proof-record ledger: the single source of `docs/ledger-index.md`, `tla/`, and the generated claims in `claim_governance.toml` |
| `paper/` | manuscripts for peer review; tables generated from `data/` (see each paper's README) |
| `vendor/` | pinned external code, never edited here |

## Reproducible checks

```sh
python scripts/check_registry.py
python vendor/vendoring/check_vendored_sync.py
PYTHONPATH=vendor python -m proof_records.generate_ledgers research/ledger.json --claims claim_governance.toml --check
PYTHONPATH=vendor python -m claim_governance.cli
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

After editing `research/ledger.json`, run `python tools/seal_ledger.py`
(recomputes the content-addressed record identifiers; an edge may name its
target as `@Name`), then drop `--check` from the generator command to
regenerate its surfaces. The TLC models in `tla/` run with
`ProofArchitecture.tla` on the library path:
`java -DTLA-Library=vendor/proof_records -jar tla2tools.jar -config tla/MCNoveltyLedgerOpen.cfg tla/MCNoveltyLedgerOpen.tla`.

## Vendored code

`vendored.toml` pins each package under `vendor/` to an upstream commit and
the SHA-256 of every file; `vendor/vendoring/check_vendored_sync.py` fails CI
on any drift or unpinned source file. To update: copy the package directory
byte for byte from upstream, then run
`python vendor/vendoring/check_vendored_sync.py pin NAME COMMIT`. Never patch
a vendored file locally; fix it upstream and re-vendor.

| Package | Upstream | Use here |
|---|---|---|
| `proof_records` (Python files and `ProofArchitecture.tla`) | `larsbx/finite-math-kernels` `kernel/proof_records` | record identity, closure, ledger generation |
| `claim_governance` | `larsbx/finite-math-kernels` `tools/claim_governance` | enforces `claim_governance.toml` |
| `vendoring` | `larsbx/finite-math-kernels` `tools/vendoring` | the checker above |

The Mojo kernels in `finite-math-kernels` (`finite_exact`, `quadratic_orbit`,
…), the Julia oracles in `julia-oracle-lab`, and the Haskell `meta_test`
framework are not vendored. Nothing here is written in those languages, and
exact ℚ arithmetic is Python's `int`/`Fraction`. Vendor one only when a
consumer in this repository exists.

N1 certificates (`docs/n1-specification.md`) are searched and checked
separately:

```sh
python experiments/n1/search.py -1 -1 > cert.json   # non-authoritative
```

The N2 defect census checks N2-T03 and the pending defect records on
finite samples (`docs/candidates/N2.md`):

```sh
python experiments/n2/defect_census.py --check
```

The N3 data generator emits a complete occupancy vector, and the analyzer
consumes it:

```sh
python experiments/n3/hurwitz_shell.py 97 13 left > data.json
python experiments/n3/analyze_collisions.py data.json
```

The N3 analyzer consumes a JSON object whose `multiplicities` field is the
list of fiber occupancies, including zeros when the complete finite target is
known:

```sh
python experiments/n3/analyze_collisions.py data.json
```

## Claim boundary

Repository artifacts may establish implementation correctness, certificate
checking, and finite experimental facts. They do not establish mathematical
novelty. Novelty requires a dated, query-recorded literature audit and a
comparison against the nearest prior art.
